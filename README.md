# HRP (SSH Remote HTTP Reverse Proxy)

Small Go app that:

- Connects to an SSH server.
- Opens a remote TCP listener on that SSH server.
- Serves HTTP on that remote TCP port.
- Proxies HTTP and upgrade requests (including WebSocket handshake) to a local HTTPS target.
- Accepts self-signed localhost certificates.
- Records per-session HTTP request/response headers and bodies.

## Build

Using `xc` (task runner):

```bash
xc build
```

Or manually with Go:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build ./...
```

The `xc build` target builds with CGO disabled and outputs the binary to `bin/hrp`.

## Run

With explicit SSH key:

```bash
go run . \
  --ssh-addr 203.0.113.10:22 \
  --ssh-user tunnel \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 \
  --remote-bind 127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --target-https https://localhost:8443 \
  --record-dir ./sessions
```

Or automatically use default SSH key (tries `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa` in order):

```bash
go run . \
  --ssh-addr 203.0.113.10:22 \
  --ssh-user tunnel \
  --remote-bind 127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --target-https https://localhost:8443 \
  --record-dir ./sessions
```

Or use password auth:

```bash
go run . \
  --ssh-addr 203.0.113.10:22 \
  --ssh-user tunnel \
  --ssh-password 'secret'
```

## SSH Authentication

- If `--ssh-key` is not specified, hrp automatically tries to use the first available default SSH key from `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
- If the SSH key is encrypted (password-protected), hrp will prompt you to enter the passphrase on stdin.
- Alternatively, provide `--ssh-password` for password-based SSH authentication.

## Important Flags

- `--ssh-insecure-host-key` (default: `true`): skips SSH host key verification.
- `--ssh-known-hosts`: use when host key verification is enabled.
- `--request-body-limit` and `--response-body-limit`: max bytes captured per exchange. `0` means unlimited.

## Tasks

### build

Build hrp with CGO disabled into bin/

```sh
mkdir -p bin
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bin/hrp .
```

## Session Recording

Each incoming TCP connection gets a separate session file:

- `sessions/<session-id>.jsonl`

Each line is a JSON object containing one HTTP exchange with:

- request metadata and headers
- request body (base64)
- response status and headers
- response body (base64)
- truncation flags and byte counts

For upgraded requests, the HTTP handshake is recorded. Raw upgraded stream bytes are not decoded.
